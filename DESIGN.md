Our project was implemented with Python, HTML, Flask, Jinja, and SQL. We wanted our website to be modern and user-friendly, as reflected in design choices. We also themed the website to be blue and orange, our school's colors. 

We used an SQL database to store data, through both storing reviews in the database and through retrieving reviews in order to be displayed. 

In the HTML documents, we used tables to display the reviews stored within the SQL database. Using CSS, we were able to style the tables with orange and blue backgrounds to represent our school spirit! Additionally, we used Jinja for-loops to iterate through the reviews in the SQL database and display them within the tables. Our HTML files also allowed us to have an interactive navigational bar that reacts to when the user hovers over certain options. We were also able to display our school spirit by including our school's logo throughout the site.
